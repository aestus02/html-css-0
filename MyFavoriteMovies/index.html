            <h2> My Fourth Favorite Movie <u>The Batman</u></h2>
            <p>The course uses psychology to analyze Batman and Batman to teach psychology. Batman is one of the best-known characters in the world, and interest in him has lasted through countless incarnations since he debuted in Detective Comics #27 in 1939. Why does this superhero without superpowers fascinate us? What does that fascination say about us? This course explores these and other intriguing questions about the masked vigilante: Does Batman have PTSD?  Why does he fight crime? Why as a vigilante? Why the mask, the bat, and the underage partner? Why are his most intimate relationships with “bad girls” he ought to lock up? And why won’t he kill that homicidal clown?
